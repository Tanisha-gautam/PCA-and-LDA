        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
Just over a year ago, we came to face the Coronavirus which has caused a worldwide pandemic. Along with all the life losses and massive spread of the virus, we have also learnt to wear masks and maintain social distancing. But as the vaccination drive started, the hospitals are filled to the brim with people lining up for the vaccine. The hospitals are overcrowded which is exactly what we should not be doing. So, we have started ‘ CROWDCON ’, an app which will solve the problem of overcrowding.
            <br><br><br><br>‘Crowdcon’ will provide the data on all the hospitals that are vaccinating the people. It will also show whether the centre is already very crowded or less. We aim to help our country during this rising pandemic. Maintaining the crowd at vaccination centres is one very important step which we will help tackle.</p>
