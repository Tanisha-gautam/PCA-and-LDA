Problem Statement

In India, we are facing operational issues such as crowd management at vaccination centers.people are standing in long queues to get vaccinated due to which there is too much crowd accumulation at vaccination centers.

Proposed Solution
To manage crowds at vaccination centers, we are building a IoT model prototype  wherein, we can calculate the approximate strength of people who are planning to get vaccinated at particular vaccination centres. Also we will provide a web application where people can go through the data about the crowd at vaccination centers.,

Instructions to run the project

    Clone the repository.
    Its is preferred to run the project in xampp. Get your xampp running and create a database in phpmyadmin named shoplocal.
    Cut/Copy paste the repository folder in xampp/htdocs.
    You can view the web application at localhost/Crowdcon/.
